A simple call blocking application that will help you avoid answering unwanted calls
using an offline phone number database.

Features:

* Showing a notification with some caller info (positive/negative rating, category, number of negative reviews and such) when the phone's ringing. ''Works offline.''
* Loading and displaying a list of reviews for a number. ''Requires internet.''
* Automatic blocking of unwanted calls (may not work on some devices; doesn't work on Android 10+). ''Works offline.''
* Automatic update of the database (for offline use). ''Requires internet.''

How to use:

* Install and launch the app.
* Press the "Download database" button on the main screen, wait for it to finish.
* At this point you should be able to see notifications with some caller info during incoming calls. You can press such a notification to load detailed online reviews.
* Toggle the "Auto-update enabled" switch (recommended) to automatically receive daily DB updates (these are delta updates, so they consume very little traffic).
* Toggle the "Block unwanted calls" switch if you want to enable automatic blocking.
* After these steps everything should just work. Enjoy!

The main phone number database is downloaded from
[https://gitlab.com/xynngh/YetAnotherCallBlocker_data a gitlab repository].
Delta updates and detailed review queries are performed using 3rd-party servers.
No user-identifiable information is sent (except for the phone number
the detailed reviews are loaded for).

Yet Another Call Blocker is still under development. Any help is very welcome.

''NonFreeNet:'' the 3rd-party service is not open source.
